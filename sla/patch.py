"""Wire the block-sparse kernel into MiniMax-H3 attention, at inference time.

The hook is ``transformer_options["optimized_attention_override"]``, read by
``wrap_attn`` in ``comfy/ldm/modules/attention.py``. H3 reaches it from its one
attention call site, ``comfy/ldm/minimax/model.py:172``.

The legacy ``set_model_attn1_patch`` hook does *not* work here: it is the
SD-UNet cross-attention path, and H3 is a DiT that never consults it. A patch
installed that way reports success and silently does nothing -- which is the
failure this whole module exists to avoid, hence the invocation counter below.

Layout at the call site: q/k/v arrive ``[1, 56, S, 128]`` bf16 with
``skip_reshape=True``, ``mask=None``, RoPE already applied. H3 does not pass
``skip_output_reshape``, so we owe it ``[1, S, 7168]`` back.

--- AMD/ROCm notes (local, not present upstream) ---
1. _OK_DTYPES includes float32. Pipelines that manual-cast attention to fp32
   (e.g. around INT8-quantized linear layers) got an unconditional dense
   fall-through on every call otherwise, regardless of min_seq_len -- looked
   identical in the logs to a sequence-length problem, wasn't one. Confirmed
   still needed against current upstream -- upstream's own _OK_DTYPES is
   still (bfloat16, float16) only.
2. The sparse kernel's own compute is optionally downcast to a fixed dtype
   around just the block-sparse call, then cast back. RDNA2 has no native
   matrix-core acceleration at all, and of its remaining paths fp16 measures
   roughly 2x bf16 throughput -- adjust _SPARSE_COMPUTE_DTYPE per your own
   hardware's measured numbers, or set it to None to leave q/k/v dtype alone.
3. In _summarise, the calls==0 branch also surfaces state["failed"] if a
   kernel exception happened on every single call -- upstream's calls==0
   branch only prints the generic "never invoked" line. Without this, a
   kernel that fails on 100% of calls (e.g. a dtype it can't handle) looks
   identical in the log to a guard-condition rejection, which cost real time
   to tell apart the first time this happened here.

Note this node's design assumes tensor-core hardware (the many small
per-block tl.dot calls in kernel.py are what tensor cores are good at
amortizing); on GPUs without that, correct sparsification does not
necessarily mean a net speedup even after both fixes above. Benchmark against
your own dense baseline before trusting the "faster" default assumption.

--- Everything else below is merged from upstream, full parity ---
dense_backend: pins every dense fall-through to a specific named attention
kernel (comfy_kitchen / pytorch / a specific sage:<mode>), resolved by direct
module import rather than by capturing whatever attention-override node
happened to run earlier in the workflow.

dense_steps: explicit 0-based step indices forced dense, on top of
dense_last_steps -- lets early composition-setting steps stay exact without
paying full-attention cost on every step.

disable_fp16_accum: forces off the fp16/bf16 reduced-precision matmul
reduction path (what --fast fp16_accumulation enables) for this model's
sampling run, regardless of the global launch flag.

stabilize_motion: biases each layer's block selection toward what it picked
last step (see block_map.py's prev_lut), to reduce a block flipping between
near-tied candidates step to step, visible on fast motion as a faint
double-exposure.

Spectrum-aware step resolution (_resolve_sampler_step / _prepare_run_state /
_reset_run_state / _call_next_wrapper / _sequence_scalar): Spectrum is a
companion node that can forecast a sampler step without invoking the
diffusion model at all. Counting wrapper invocations therefore counts actual
NFEs, not sampler steps, and drifts out of sync with dense_steps/
dense_last_steps if any step gets skipped that way. ComfyUI exposes both the
complete schedule (sample_sigmas) and the live raw sigma (sigmas);
_resolve_sampler_step recovers the true sampler position by matching the two,
so step counting stays correct whether or not Spectrum -- or anything else
that can skip model calls -- is in the graph. _call_next_wrapper also
replaces a bare executor.original() call: that would jump straight to the
base model and silently skip every wrapper installed *after* this one (e.g.
Spectrum's own H3 instrumentation), where advancing the wrapper chain
preserves them.
