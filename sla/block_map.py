"""Block selection: which key blocks each query block is allowed to see.

Vendored from LightX2V (Apache-2.0):

  https://github.com/ModelTC/LightX2V

This is the whole of what "SLA" does at inference time. Mean-pool Q into blocks,
mean-pool a smoothed K into blocks, score the two against each other with one
small matmul, and keep the top ``topk_ratio`` fraction of key blocks per query
block. No weights, nothing trained, nothing to load -- the published SLA LoRA
adapts the *model* to tolerate the resulting sparsity, it does not parameterise
this step.

Three changes against upstream, marked FIX:

1. ``other=0.0`` on the masked load. The masked lanes feed ``tl.sum`` two lines
   later, and Triton leaves them undefined, so the final (partial) block of the
   sequence pooled whatever was in memory. Upstream fixed exactly this in the
   BHSD twin of this file and did not port the fix here.
2. ``max(1, ...)`` on the top-k count, so a short sequence keeps one key block
   rather than zero. Also upstream's BHSD-only fix.
3. Smooth-k is folded into the pooled result instead of being materialised.
   Pooling is a mean over L and the correction is constant along L, so
   ``pool(k - mu) == pool(k) - mu`` exactly. Upstream builds the whole smoothed
   copy of K, which at 768p/15s is a needless ~1.3 GB allocation.

    ``q``/``k`` are ``(B, L, H, D)`` contiguous. ``lut`` comes back as
    ``(B, H, ceil(LQ/BLKQ), topk)`` int32, contiguous, ready for the kernel.

    ``protect_upto`` pins the first N tokens into every query block's selection.
    For H3 that is the ``[text | cond | audio]`` prefix, and it exists because
    plain top-k starves audio: at 768p/15s the audio is ~1% of the packed
    sequence (19 key blocks of 1794), so nothing makes a query keep any of it,
    and the smooth-k mean it is scored against is 99% video. The pinned blocks
    are added on top of the top-k budget rather than displacing video, so video
    coverage is unchanged and the extra cost is the prefix itself (~7%).

    ``prev_lut``, when given the previous call's ``lut`` for this same layer,
    nudges those blocks' scores up before top-k -- pure per-step top-k has no
    memory, so on a near-tie between two similarly-scored blocks the winner
    can flip step to step for no reason tied to actual content, and on fast
    motion that shows up as a faint double-exposure rather than one clean
    pick. The nudge only breaks a close call; a block that's actually a
    better fit this step still wins. Silently ignored if its shape doesn't
    match this call's (e.g. right after a dense step, or the first sparse
    call of a run).
